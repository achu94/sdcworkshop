## [Workshop Contracts](./workshop-contracts)
During the workshop, participants will create 3 different contracts to learn and understand core principles for creating & testing Smart Contracts on XPR Network.

## XPR Reward
Everybody who participates in the workshop, will be eligible to get XPR in two ways.

### [1. Redemption of Gift Cards](https://app.metalx.com/gift)
Gift cards will be created and distributed to all on-site participants. Each gift card will include an amount of `3000.0000 XPR`.

### [2. Development of Smart Contracts (Homework)](./homework-contract)
Any developer who has a GitHub account can register for the homework task by creating an issue using following form and providing their XPR account.

#### Please Note
Remote participants will only be added to our contract if they meet one of the following requirements:

We reserve the right to remove accounts if we identify that somebody tries to register with multiple accounts.
